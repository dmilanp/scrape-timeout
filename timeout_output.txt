The season begins with Imogen Stidworthy's 'The Whisper Heard' exploring language, meaning and identity (Feb 4- Apr 24) followed by Kerry Tribe's 'H.M' (Apr 26-Jul 24) and Shona Illingworth's 'Lesions in the Landscape' (July 26-Oct 16).

	Knightmare Live!
	'Welcome, watchers of illusion, to the castle of confusion.' Yep, the slapstick stage show version of the iconic kids' TV show takes up residency at the Udderbelly. There's no CGI realm here, rather some shambolic sets and costumes, but it's mighty fun to both play and observe, with Tom Bell making a brilliant Lord Fear. It always sells out, so book soon.


	Alex Edelman: Everything Handed To You
	This young comic's confident delivery, smart jokes and brilliantly pedantic stories have wowed audiences and critics alike. The Foster's Edinburgh Comedy Awards judges loved him, and awarded the New York- and Boston-raised comic Best Newcomer for 'Millennial', his assured debut.

	States of Mind: Tracing the Edges of Consciousness
	This exhibition follows on from the first instalment of States of Mind which saw artist Ann Veronica Janssens fill a room with beautiful multicoloured mist which visitors queued for hours to get enveloped in. Enlisting the help of artists, philosophers, neuroscientists and psychologists, the second part of the programme, Tracing the Edges of Consciousness unpicks the awareness of one's existence through a series of changing installations exploring synaesthesia, disorders of memory, somnambulism and what happens when conscious experience is interrupted. The season begins with Imogen Stidworthy's 'The Whisper Heard' exploring language, meaning and identity (Feb 4- Apr 24) followed by Kerry Tribe's 'H.M' (Apr 26-Jul 24) and Shona Illingworth's 'Lesions in the Landscape' (July 26-Oct 16).

	Bogan Bingo
	Think bingo is boring? So do this lot, which is why they created a brilliant, bizarre, boozy and unashamedly silly alternative. Two 'Wayne's World'-styled hosts throw serious shapes to the likes of Bon Jovi and 'Eye of the Tiger' while calling the numbers. There are numerous prizes to be won, including the coveted Bogan Bingo lunch box, plenty of classic '80s pub rock and floods of stonewashed denim.


	Busta Rhymes
	Two decades in the game and with his stock as high as ever, 'Bussa Bus' is still one of the most inventive personalities in the rap game, with a huge back catalogue of old-school classics to lay on you.
