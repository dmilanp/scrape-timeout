<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept Under the Carpet? Servants in London Households 1600-2000</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliant period rooms in Geffreye Museum are having an upstairs-downstairs makeover for a new exhibition that examines the changing roles of servants (that used to literally include nit-picking) in middle class households over the last 400 years and confronts the reality of domestic service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grab a free sarnie from Covent Garden's latest food joint during their soft opening this summer. The cafe which will be serving up authentic delicatessen favourites will give the first 50 diners through their doors between noon-1pm a full-size signature Reuben sandwich free of charge.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifeboat</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join the slowest ride on earth.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;States of Mind: Tracing the Edges of Consciousness</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exhibition follows on from the first instalment of States of Mind which saw artist Ann Veronica Janssens fill a room with beautiful multicoloured mist which visitors queued for hours to get enveloped in. Enlisting the help of artists, philosophers, neuroscientists and psychologists, the second part of the programme, Tracing the Edges of Consciousness unpicks the awareness of one's existence through a series of changing installations exploring synaesthesia, disorders of memory, somnambulism and what happens when conscious experience is interrupted. The season begins with Imogen Stidworthy's 'The Whisper Heard' exploring language, meaning and identity (Feb 4- Apr 24) followed by Kerry Tribe's 'H.M' (Apr 26-Jul 24) and Shona Illingworth's 'Lesions in the Landscape' (July 26-Oct 16).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now entering its 248th consecutive year, the RA's summer show is the world's longest-running open-submission exhibition. As ever, the work of heavy-hitters will hang alongside that of younger, emerging artists. An annual gem.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinka Shonibare: Globe Head Ballerina</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commission by artist Yinka Shonibare, produced by Up Projects for the Royal Opera House. Titled 'Globe Head Ballerina', the work is inspired by a famous photograph of ballerina Margot Fonteyn. Shonibare's sculpture depicts a life-size ballerina, modelled on Melissa Hamilton, a soloist with the Royal Ballet. Encased in a giant 'snow globe', the figure, whose head is a replica Victorian globe, rotates slowly. Her tutu is made of fabrics that are synonymous with Shonibare's work and his exploration of the ambiguities of heritage and identity; originally manufactured by the Dutch for sale in the Indonesian market, the fabrics have become a symbol of African identity, having eventually been sold to the colonies in West Africa. The work is displayed on the exterior of the building overlooking Russell Street and will remain in place for five years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big, bold new summer pop-up hits Brixton for 14 weekends of daytime parties on a rooftop beach. Miami circa 1982 is the inspiration and cocktails, DJs, retro film screenings, food stalls and live sports broadcasts are all on the cards, so slick back that hair, pull on a white tuxedo and hope for some suitably tropical weather.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think bingo is boring? So do this lot, which is why they created a brilliant, bizarre, boozy and unashamedly silly alternative. Two 'Wayne's World'-styled hosts throw serious shapes to the likes of Bon Jovi and 'Eye of the Tiger' while calling the numbers. There are numerous prizes to be won, including the coveted Bogan Bingo lunch box, plenty of classic '80s pub rock and floods of stonewashed denim.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rahat is a leading exponent of qawwali, the devotional music of the Islamic Sufi tradition. He's from a long line of Pakistani qawwali vocalists, and first sang on stage in the UK in 1985 when he was only nine years old with a group led his famous uncle Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Since then, Rahat has gone on to write and sing for hundreds of films in Bollywood, Hollywood and Lollywood (that's the film industry of Lahore). After selling out Wembley Arena in 2012, he'll be filling up yet another enormous London venue with his powerful voice as he performs religious and secular songs tonight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's event was a modern resurrection of the centuries-old fair on Camberwell Green, which was shut down in the mid-nineteenth century because of its reputation for working-class debauchery. This year the free event has moved to Burgess Park to accommodate double the live music, activities and fun. See the Camberwell Fair website for the full line up.</p>

They've worked with D'Angelo, Q-Tip and DJ Jazzy Jeff and still pack a powerful punch, despite the tragic loss of both producer J Dilla in 2006 and rapper Baatin in 2009. The group is now made up of the one remaining founding member, T3 and J Dilla's brother Illa J.</p>
